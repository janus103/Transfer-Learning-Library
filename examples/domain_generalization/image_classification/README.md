# Domain Generalization for Image Classification

## Installation
Example scripts can deal with [WILDS datasets](https://wilds.stanford.edu/).
You should first install ``wilds`` before using these scripts.

```
pip install wilds
```

Example scripts also support all models in [PyTorch-Image-Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models).
You also need to install timm to use PyTorch-Image-Models.

```
pip install timm
```

## Dataset

Following datasets can be downloaded automatically:

- [Office31](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/domainadapt/)
- [OfficeHome](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html)
- [DomainNet](http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/)
- [PACS](https://domaingeneralization.github.io/#data)
- [iwildcam (WILDS)](https://wilds.stanford.edu/datasets/)
- [camelyon17 (WILDS)](https://wilds.stanford.edu/datasets/)
- [fmow (WILDS)](https://wilds.stanford.edu/datasets/)

## Experiment and Results

The shell files give the script to reproduce the [benchmarks](/docs/dglib/benchmarks/image_classification.rst) with specified hyper-parameters.
For example, if you want to reproduce IRM on Office-Home, use the following script

```shell script
# Train with IRM on Office-Home Ar Cl Rw -> Pr task using ResNet 50.
# Assume you have put the datasets under the path `data/office-home`, 
# or you are glad to download the datasets automatically from the Internet to this path
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python irm.py data/office-home -d OfficeHome -s Ar Cl Rw -t Pr -a resnet50 --seed 0 --log logs/irm/OfficeHome_Pr
```
